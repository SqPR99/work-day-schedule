It's very straight forward as it is. It will sync to your local time and update as the day goes along on refresh, red is set as the current hour, grey is set if the time been a previous hour and green is for the future times. When you write any task in a block and then hit save it will save it to your local storage and still be there on reset. If you want to get rid of it you can delete it and hit save again.
